believe there’s intelligent life on planets. And the most plausible why they haven’t contacted us that we’re too boring. I we haven’t even figured out to send information faster than Pathetic. But wait, let me You’ve heard that it’s impossible send information faster than the of light because, er, physics. I’ve heard that too. But think it’s wrong. And in video, I want to explain Is it possible to break speed of light limit? That’s we’ll talk about today. If been following this channel for really long time, first of thank you, I know it always easy. Second, you may that I made a video faster than light travel already few years ago. But I no one understood it. In when I watched it again I didn’t understand it either. please give me a second Because I think it’s becoming relevant to get this right. this time, I’ll try to it better. I’ll even let leave the toilet seat up. the past year or so, been a lot of talk unexplained aerial phenomena, formerly known UFOs. I don’t actually believe of those are of extra-terrestrial because, as I said, we’re too boring for aliens to visiting us. Then again, what I know? Maybe some of aerial phenomena really are space from alien species. And if want to properly evaluate how that is, we need to about the possibility of travelling than light, or at least information faster than light. Because it’s possible at all, then what the aliens are doing. Speed of Light as Limit idea that the speed of is a limit comes from Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity. this guy again. The speed light plays a special role his theory because it’s the speed that’s the same for observers. And just to make I mean the speed of in vacuum. The speed of in a medium, any medium, slower than the speed of in vacuum, and depends on you move relative to the But the speed of light vacuum does *not depend on fast you move because there’s for you to move relative I know this sounds about exciting as flossing teeth, but has some unexpected consequences, and don’t mean that your crowns off. Suppose you and your let’s call him Bob, both a water hose, and it out water at, say 10 per hour. Bob gets on train which moves at 200 per hour. If you live the United States, make that then he turns on his hose again. The water moves 10 kilometres per hour relative him. But how fast does move relative to you? You’d it to be the speed the water plus the speed the train, right? Now imagine don’t have water hoses but pointers. They send out light well, the speed of light. friend Bob gets on a again. In vacuum, of course. this is theoretical physics, where don’t breathe, cows are spheres, 3 is either equal to or infinity, depending on whom ask. How fast do you the light of Bob’s laser? expect this to be faster the light that comes out your laser pointer by the of the train, but not It moves with the exact speed as yours. Because the of light is always the This is what was confirmed the famous Michaelson-Morley experiment, and has a very odd consequence: can’t catch up with light. doesn’t matter how fast the is, light will still move from it with the speed light. If that didn’t make crowns pop off you’ve probably it so many times before you’ve forgotten how remarkable it That, or you have a good dentist. We can quantify difficulty of catching up with by asking how much energy takes to accelerate an object. suppose the object has a m. This mass corresponds to energy which is given by most famous equation ever, E m c square, where E the energy and c is speed of light. But now accelerate this massive object from velocity to some other velocity, The energy you need for acceleration is the total energy the object at the new minus the energy it previously In Einstein’s theory, the total of an object that moves to you with velocity v given by this expression. Now you want to know the energy, you take this and the same expression for zero So you get this somewhat expression, but don’t despair, it as bad as it looks. one thing, when the velocity, is much smaller than the of light, then the ratio over c is much smaller one. In this case, the thing with the square root approximately one plus one half over c square, the one out and the c’s cancel and you get one half v square, which you might is just the kinetic energy. we’re more interested in the where the velocity gets close the speed of light, so over c gets close to Then this factor gets close zero, and the entire energy close to one over zero, is infinity. This means if want to accelerate an object it reaches the speed of you need an infinite amount energy. Another way to put is that the only way can move at the speed light is when your mass zero. Even a keto diet going to do that for This is where the idea from that the speed of is a limit that you cross. But… this argument has issues. The first issue is it doesn’t mean faster The of Light as Barrier than travel is forbidden in Einstein’s Indeed, his theory is entirely with faster-than-light travel. The problem to be instead that you accelerate from below the speed light to above the speed light. It’s more like a than a limit. The second is more a peculiarity. It’s on all other occasions when see some quantity go to they’ll tell you that infinity unphysical and a sign that maths doesn’t properly work. Big black holes, non-renormalizable effective field whatever. If there’s a singularity, say it’s a mathematical artefact not real. They don’t say in this case, and I they should. The third issue that we have a counterexample the claim that one needs infinite amount of energy to the speed of light, which the argument extremely suspect. But see why I say this, first need to tell you mass comes from. No, it’s too much cheese, it’s simpler that. Most of the mass objects around you isn’t really it’s binding energy. You see, the entire mass of atoms in the nucleus. The nucleus made of neutrons and protons, the neutrons and protons are made of three quarks. For neutron that’s two down and up, and for the proton two up and one down. not thumbs, I mean. The do have masses, but if add them together, the sum far less than the mass either the neutron or proton. most of the mass of and protons is the binding from the strong nuclear force holds them together. We *interpret as mass because E equals c square. But this means really odd to put the of an object into this in Einstein’s formula. Because really you look at the object most of it isn’t mass. yes, that means most of isn’t mass either. You’re almost made of pure energy. Though I see how much time spend watching YouTube I find hard to believe. What’s with remaining mass, the part that binding energy? Electrons and quarks have masses, albeit very small These masses come from the not to be confused with Higgs-boson. To be more precise, masses come from the condensed field. This Higgs-field condensate fills entire universe and drags on It’s kind of like the century aether, but with two differences. First, the aether was to be necessary for light travel. But for the Higgs-field the opposite. The particles of the photons, are massless, which they don’t feel the Higgs at all. But other particles feel it. When the field it sticks to the particles. slows them down and it to us like they have mass. Another difference between the Higgs-field and the aether is the Higgs-condensate looks the same everyone, regardless of how fast move. It’s just a number each point in space-time and agrees on what this number It’s like the number of in your washing machine. Doesn’t how fast the spin cycle the number of socks doesn’t Or if it does, I it’s time for new socks. aether on the other hand believed to be basically like fluid. Some people would drift the flow, and some people move against it, and they’d different things. This is *not case for the Higgs-field and condensate. If you like technical and I just know you it’s a Lorentz-scalar and invariant Poincare transformations. Ok, so the of fundamental particles come from Higgs-field. But. This is only case when the field is and that wasn’t the case the early universe. Think of early morning in spring. No, the coffee, I mean the on the grass. Where does come from? Well, air contains vapour, which means that individual molecules float around in the But warm air can hold water vapour than cold air. the air temperature drops during night, the water molecules collect form drops which are too to keep floating, and they to the ground. The Higgs has done a very similar not at night, but in early universe. In the early it was really hot. There a Higgs-field but it wasn’t kind of like the water in the air. But then temperature dropped, and the Higgs condensed. This condensate now fills entire universe. But it was when the Higgs field condensed particles acquired masses. It’s a transition called “electroweak symmetry breaking” it’s believed to have happened 10 to the minus 11 after the Big Bang at temperature of 10 to the Kelvin, that’s much hotter than the centre of the sun. all this means is that the early universe none of particles had masses. They were massless, and they were all with the speed of light. they were not. And here’s important bit: The energy that released in this phase transition finite. If it hadn’t been, wouldn’t be here, and someone have written a paper about I’m sure. But the equation we looked at earlier said the difference in energy should been infinite. What gives? Mathematically pretty obvious what goes wrong the earlier argument. If you at this equation again, you that if this factor goes zero, but the mass *also to zero, then the ratio well remain finite. This doesn’t us at all to travel the speed of light. Because can’t just uncondense the Higgs Even if we could, it’d evaporate the traveller and, I I’m not a doctor, but probably not healthy. So, this going to let us build warp drive. But it shows the argument that the speed light is a barrier isn’t technically correct. Time Travel Paradoxes is another reason that physicists bring up for why you travel faster than the speed light, which is that it allegedly cause time-travel paradoxes. The goes like this. Suppose Alice a spaceship which goes by than the speed of light. there it goes. Her friend can’t afford the new super-duper and lamely zooms by in year’s model, at merely 90 the speed of light. Then would see the space-ship going in time. Let’s draw this a space-time diagram to see The horizontal axis depicts one of space, so left and for example. And the vertical is time. A spaceship which move, according to this axis, makes a vertical line. A at constant velocity is a which moves at some angle. convention a 45-degree angle is speed of light. Alice just there and moves on this line. And everything that happens a perfectly horizontal line happens according to Alice. The faster-than-light goes by like this. And moves on this line. The is now what Bob sees. this, let’s look at two events. And let’s make sure events have a clear arrow time from entropy increase, let’s someone drops a raw egg. guy in the spaceship stumbles and the egg smashes to ground here. This means, importantly, time on the space-ship passes this direction, and *not in other direction. Since Bob is relative to Alice, he sees events happen simultaneously. I explained previously in my video on the past still exists. So, either take my word for or watch the other video. Bob, events that happen at times are on these straight not on horizontal lines. You then see that for Bob order of events is that egg first smashes to the and then gets dropped. It that for Bob the time of the faster than light is reversed, crazy! The first you may have to this Who cares what Bob sees? mean you can watch this in reverse and that doesn’t I actually spoke in reverse. enough. The second reaction is point out that this isn’t either Alice or Bob see You can’t see a faster light ship coming for the reason you can’t hear a plane coming. What do you to see it with? Instead, Alice and Bob will only the spaceship after it’s gone and then they’ll see it away in both directions. And you can say, so what? mean gravitational lensing distorts galaxies rings, alright, but that doesn’t the galaxy is a ring. just some weird trick on perception. And that’s entirely correct… you know, physicists have noticed too. Thing is, this wasn’t entire argument. There’s a piece which goes like this. Imagine are Bob, and there’s really spaceship that can go faster light and according to you goes back in time. Let’s ask what this means but you can do with it. the time on the spaceship goes forward this way, then can give a message to guys as they come by. take your message to Andromeda, it over to another faster-than spaceship, and the second ship the message back to you. would then arrive before you it. This means you could messages to yourself back in and *that causes a lot trouble. Imagine that this video disturbs you and you send message to your younger self not watch it, then you’d have sent the message in first place, so did you, didn’t you watch it? This of construction is also called time-like closed loop, it’s a in time. The argument then that if faster-than-light travel was that would lead to causality so it must be impossible. this argument is also wrong. reason is that just because to Bob there’s a spaceship that way with a time goes forward on the space-ship a direction that Bob calls in time, that doesn’t mean a space-ship goes that way its internal forward-in time direction be that way. If the on the ship goes that they can’t deliver a message your younger self. Instead, your self can send a message and nothing’s weird about that. do have a reason to that time on the space-ship go this way, but it’s a good reason. It’s because special relativity all observers must treated the same. In Special if you think that this possible, then this must also possible. But Special Relativity is because it doesn’t contain gravity this means it doesn’t actually reality. For this, we need relativity. And while the time-travel is correct in special relativity, is not correct in general I know this video is tough going so let’s stop a moment to appreciate where are. I summarised the usual for why faster than light leads to time-travel paradoxes. I’m to explain why this argument apply in the real universe. usual argument uses special relativity to which only relative velocities physically relevant. In special relativity, can’t be at a velocity absolute zero, that just makes sense. But the real universe stuff, as you’ve probably noticed. can take all this stuff, the average velocity that it with. And then you can absolute rest to be motion has no relative velocity to average of all that stuff. you like technical terms so it’s called the “co-moving frame”. the reference frame that moves with matter in the universe. are currently not at rest to the average of stuff the universe because the earth around the sun and the goes around the centre of milky way and the milky is rushing towards something called big attractor that no one knows what it is. If wanted to be at rest the universe you’d have to at 300 kilometres per second this direction. No, wait. This. this? Alright, so there’s matter the universe that moves one and not another. But what this have to do with time-travel story? Suppose you are again but now you are in a universe with general and you are moving with stuff, you are in the frame. And now assume that than light travel is only forward in time in this frame. In this case you make loops in time, regardless what Bob thinks he sees. co-moving frame defines one direction forward in time. The only Bob can do is send signals to Andromeda, and there’s Paradoxical about that. You may now what the motion of should have to do with possibility of faster-than light travel? is a very good question which the answer is: Quite nothing. I just used this an example. It’s an example show that faster-than-light travel does necessarily imply time-travel paradoxes. The just doesn’t follow from the To add one final reason you shouldn’t trust the argument faster-than-light travel is impossible is we know our current theory space-time, General Relativity, can’t be because it doesn’t work together quantum theory. This is why need a theory of quantum and we still don’t have We know however that causality locality become really screwed up quantum mechanics, and the same probably the case in quantum This is why I think extremely implausible that any argument faster-than-light travel would survive in to-be-found theory of quantum gravity. course you already know that one’s figured out how to faster than the speed of But I hope I have to convince at least some you that the formal reasons may have heard against it on shaky grounds. This is I believe physicists should think little harder about faster-than-light travel. the very least, then maybe wouldn’t be so boring.
